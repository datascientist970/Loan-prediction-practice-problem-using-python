## The workflow includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

One-Hot Encoding of categorical features

Train/Test Split

Machine Learning Pipeline

Model tuning using XGBoost + GridSearchCV

Model Evaluation & Reporting



## How to Run

Clone repository

pip install -r requirements.txt

Install dependencies:

Run notebook or Python script
